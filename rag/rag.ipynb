INTRODUCTION\\nAs defined by the World Health Organization (WHO), ‘Health is a state of complete physical, mental and social \\nwell-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity.’ This acknowledgment of mental health as an \\nintegral component of health was also echoed by Dr. Brock Chisholm, the first Director-General of WHO, who \\ndeclared in 1954 that “without mental health there can be no true physical health.”   \\nMental health problems can have a wide impact on all areas of life. Depression is now one of the leading causes \\nof disability worldwide. \\xa0 Around 20% of the world’s children and adolescents suffer from a mental health \\nproblem while suicide is the second leading cause of death among 15-29-year-olds.\\nConcerns about mental health have become particularly relevant in the context of the COVID- 19 pandemic. \\nMyriad changes in lifestyle coupled with social isolation, economic uncertainties and apprehension about the \\ndisease itself has caused a substantial increase in mental health problems.\\nIn this background, it is of paramount importance for budding healthcare professionals to have basic mental \\nhealth knowledge which would sensitize them to identify any mental health problem among themselves, \\nfamily, friends and community at large, leading to early intervention.\\nHealthcare professionals, including medical and paramedical students form a subset of the general population \\nwho are predisposed for burnout and mental exhaustion which may lead to psychiatric problems.\\nStigma associated with psychiatric illness is a major barrier to treatment. The students can be torch bearers \\nto remove this stigma among themselves and the general population. A significant proportion of the total \\ncaseload in primary healthcare settings involve persons with mental illnesses. Usually, these persons present \\nwith common mental health problems or as a comorbid condition of other physical disorders and are missed \\nor inappropriately managed. Considering the huge burden of mental illnesses, it is necessary to make efforts \\nfor the inculcation of an empathetic attitude toward psychiatric disorders and psychiatry as a speciality at the \\nundergraduate level. During training, educational interventions targeted towards them may be highly effective. \\nPerception and knowledge of the nursing and paramedical staff about mental illnesses is also important as they \\ndirectly deal with patients and their relatives, and are also involved in disseminating health information.\\nMisconceptions about mental illnesses, even among healthcare professionals cause people to feel ashamed and \\nembarrassed about their condition, leading to denial of the problem and refusal to seek help.'),\n",

MYTHS ABOUT MENTAL ILLNESS\\n•\\t Psychiatric illness is a sign of weakness\\n No, there are not. Psychiatric disorders have neurobiological underpinnings and need to be treated \\naccordingly.\\n•\\t Psychiatric illness means ‘Madness’\\n Not all psychiatric disorders are ‘madness’. Only 1% of psychiatric disorders (e.g. schizophrenia and related \\npsychotic disorders) have symptoms of ‘madness’ or psychotic symptoms. Rest is not. \\n•\\t Mental health problems are permanent. You need to take medicines lifelong. \\n No. Not all psychiatric disorders are lifelong. Each individual’s experience with mental illness is different. \\nThe course of various psychiatric disorders can differ but\\xa0many people recover to a variable degree.\\n•\\t Psychiatric medications are addictive\\n No, they are not. These medicines need to be taken as per doctor’s advice. On sudden stoppage, some people \\nmay experience discontinuation symptoms. Therefore, the dose of these medicines needs to be tapered. \\n•\\t People with mental disorders are kept in asylums\\n No. Most of the psychiatric disorders can be treated at home. Only few people with chronic psychiatric \\ndisorders with poor social support and homeless mentally ill people are kept / treated in asylums.\\n•\\t Addiction implies lack of willpower\\n No, it does not. As with other psychiatric disorders, addiction has a neurobiological basis.\\n•\\t All people with mental illnesses are violent.\\n This is a common myth often perpetuated by erroneous portrayals in media and literature. In reality only \\na small percentage of people with certain psychiatric disorders become violent and unpredictable. Also, \\nthere are evidences to suggest that, ‘normal’ people are more violent compared to persons with psychiatric \\ndisorders.\\n•\\t Electro-Convulsive Therapy (ECT) or Shock Therapy is bad\\n ECT is not bad. When given under anaesthesia (i.e. modified ECT) it works wonder for certain severe \\nmental health conditions. However, because of wrong portrayal by media and in movies, general people \\ndeveloped this idea.'),\n",

COMMON PSYCHIATRIC DISORDERS \\n1. Depression\\n‘I often feel sad and low for minor reasons. Does this mean I am suffering from depression?’\\nDepression is a common psychiatric illness characterized by persistent and pervasive low mood, reduced interest \\nin previously pleasurable activities, decreased energy, decreased self-confidence, decreased concentration, \\npessimism, ideas of guilt and worthlessness, impaired sleep and in severe cases, suicidal ideas or acts. These \\nabove-mentioned symptoms should persist for most of the time of most of the days for at least 2 weeks. Various \\npsychosocial and environmental stressors play a major role.\\nPrompt identification of the signs and symptoms and early intervention can treat such episodes effectively. \\nMedication, psychotherapy or a combination of both can be used to treat depression.\\nWhat is of concern?\\n•\\t Any noticeable change in behaviour\\n•\\t Being sad or moody \\n•\\t Withdrawal from others\\n•\\t Changes in appearance, appetite or sleep pattern\\n•\\t Dangerous or self- injurious behaviour\\n•\\t Experiencing recent trauma or life crisis\\n•\\t Expressing hopelessness and desire to end life, making preparations for any such act. Threatening about \\ncommitting suicide or talking about wanting to die should always be taken seriously. Not everyone who is \\nconsidering suicide will say so, and not everyone who threatens suicide will follow through with it. However, \\nevery threat of suicide should be taken seriously. Any previous suicide attempt is an important risk factor for \\nany such subsequent attempt.\\nWhom should I contact if I experience such feelings or notice such changes in a friend? \\nGuardian/Parent/Trusted adult/ Teacher/ Mental health professional\\nHow to take care of myself?\\n•\\t Consult a mental healthcare provider. Follow the prescribed treatment diligently\\n•\\t Regular physical exercise.\\n•\\t Maintain regular timing for meals and sleep.\\n•\\t Express your feelings to trusted friends.\\n•\\t Avoid abuse of substances like alcohol and nicotine.\\nHow can I help a friend who is depressed?\\n•\\t Be patient, supportive and empathetic.\\n•\\t Listen to him/ her.'),\n",

Bipolar Affective Disorder\\nBipolar disorder is a mood disorder characterized by fluctuations in mood, energy, activity levels, concentration, \\nand the ability to carry out day-to-day tasks. There may be alternating episodes of depression and manic/\\nhypomanic episodes. Manic episodes are characterised by elated mood, increased energy, goal directed \\noveractivity, over-religiosity, pressure of speech, buying spree, engagement in high-risk behaviours, increased \\nlibido, decreased need for sleep. Bipolar disorder is usually diagnosed during late adolescence or early adulthood. \\nAlthough the course of illness may vary over time, bipolar disorder requires long-term treatment. Bipolar \\ndisorder can affect every aspect of a person’s life, including their relationships, family and work life.\\xa0\\n3. Schizophrenia/ Psychosis\\nSchizophrenia and psychoses are serious mental disorders which causes significant disability. The diagnosis \\nis associated with stigma and persons suffering from it often face discrimination. People with schizophrenia \\nhave an impaired perception of reality. Delusions, hallucinations, disorganization of thought and behaviour, \\ndifficulties with memory, attention and problem-solving abilities are often co existent. Treatment involves \\nmedication, psychoeducation, family interventions, and psychosocial rehabilitation. In most of the cases, life-\\nlong medication is required.\\nAwareness among medical students and an empathetic approach is necessary to deal with the widespread \\nstigma and discrimination.\\n4. Anxiety disorders\\nAnxiety is a normal experience.  However, constant worrying, apprehension, inability to relax, overwhelming \\nanxiety in particular situations can be indicative of pathological anxiety or an anxiety disorder. Students may \\nhave pre-existing anxious trait and with exposure to stress they can be manifested. Many students use alcohol \\nor other substances to combat anxiety which is not only unhealthy but also compounds the problem.\\nObsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) is a type of anxiety disorder characterized by obsessions (repeated, \\nintrusive, unwanted, distressing thoughts, images and impulses) and compulsions (repetitive acts that are \\nperformed to reduce the anxiety caused by the obsession).\\n5. Substance misuse\\nSubstance misuse has become rampant in the student population. Students usually abuse substances like \\nnicotine, alcohol, cannabis as coping methods with stress. Often, they are initiated into substance use by peers \\nwhich eventually leads to substance dependence. All major substances abused have lifelong psychological and \\nphysical impacts. Substance abuse can also increase impulsivity and risk-taking behaviours like unprotected \\nsex, dangerous driving, legal problems.'),\n",

Excessive \\nuse of the substance, craving for it, desire to take the substance, gradually increasing the dose of substance \\nabused, facing physical and psychological problems once the substance is stopped and neglecting other life \\npleasures encompasses some of the common presentations. \\n6. Ragging/Bullying\\nRagging, bullying (both in person and cyberbullying) can lead to low self-esteem, feelings of worthlessness, \\nanxiety and depression. \\nIf you face this issue, contact the college authorities for assistance. \\nDo not react to the bully or be aggressive. \\nKnow that it is not your fault. \\n7. Self-harm\\nSometimes self-harming behaviours are used as a coping mechanism. By hurting themselves, people seek relief \\nfrom emotional pain or overwhelming situations and experiences. Self-harming or self-injurious behaviours \\ninclude- wrist slashing, burning, hitting, head- banging etc. It is often a ‘cry’ for help.\\nIf you or someone you know is self-harming, contact mental healthcare professional immediately.'),\n",

STRESS MANAGEMENT MODULE\\nIntroduction\\nMental health is defined as a state of well-being in which every individual realizes his or her own potential, can \\ncope with the normal stressors of life, can work productively and fruitfully and is able to make a contribution \\nto his or her community.\\nStress feels uncomfortable, but not every uncomfortable feeling is stress. Stress has been dubbed the “Health \\nEpidemic of the 21st Century” by the World Health Organization. People use the word “Stress” interchangeable \\nwith other terms such as worry, anxiety and fear, but stress is, at its heart, our conviction that we won’t be able \\nto cope with the challenges we’re facing.\\nStress affects the whole person, i.e., in all the human dimensions (physical, emotional, intellectual, social, and \\nspiritual). The perception of stress and the responses to it are highly individualized, not only from person to \\nperson but also from one time to another in the same person.\\nBroadly, the stress is classified into two:\\nEustress - good stress, is stress that benefits our health, like physical exercise or getting a promotion.\\nDistress - stress that harms our health and often results from imbalances between demands made upon us and \\nour resources for dealing with these demands. The latter is what most people think about when they talk about \\nstress. However, if handled well stress can increase motivation and stimulate us.\\nStressors \\nStressor can be any stimulus that causes an individual to experience stress. Three major categories of stressors \\nare: -\\n•\\t Catastrophic events\\n•\\t Important life events (personal stressors)\\n•\\t Daily hassles (background stressors)\\nCause of stress & its effects\\nEveryone has different stress triggers.

This kind of stress is short-term and temporary (acute \\nstress), and your body usually recovers quickly from it.'),\n",

Problem-focused coping- It includes taking direct action to solve problems as well as changing or modifying \\nthe stressful problem or the source of stress. Problem focused strategy leads to change in behaviour or \\nthe development of a plan of action to deal with stress.

City Medical College, Durgapur  and  Dr  Kaustav Chakraborty Head, Department of Psychiatry College of Medicine and J N M  Hospital, Kalyani, Nadia  with inputs from  all Heads of the Department of Psychiatry of  Medical Colleges of West Bengal    Acknowledgement Prof  (Dr ) Suhrita Paul, Hon’ble Vice Chancellor The West Bengal University of Health Sciences  for her continuous encouragement for the promotion  of Mental Health Awareness among studentsContents Introduction     Myths about Mental Illness    Challenges faced by a student    Common Psychiatric Disorders    Stress Management Module   Mental Health Awareness Booklet   A  INTRODUCTION As defined by the World Health Organization (WHO), ‘Health is a state of complete physical, mental and social  well being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity ’ This acknowledgment of mental health as an  integral component of health was also echoed by Dr  Brock Chisholm, the first Director General of WHO, who  declared in   that “without mental health there can be no true physical health ”    Mental health problems can have a wide impact on all areas of life  Depression is now one of the leading causes  of disability worldwide  \\xa0 Around  % of the world’s children and adolescents suffer from a mental health  problem while suicide is the second leading cause of death among     year olds  Concerns about mental health have become particularly relevant in the context of the COVID    pandemic   Myriad changes in lifestyle coupled with social isolation, economic uncertainties and apprehension about the  disease itself has caused a substantial increase in mental health problems  In this background, it is of paramount importance for budding healthcare professionals to have basic mental  health knowledge which would sensitize them to identify any mental health problem among themselves,  family, friends and community at large, leading to early intervention  Healthcare professionals, including medical and paramedical students form a subset of the general population  who are predisposed for burnout and mental exhaustion which may lead to psychiatric problems  Stigma associated with psychiatric illness is a major barrier to treatment  The students can be torch bearers  to remove this stigma among themselves and the general population  A significant proportion of the total  caseload in primary healthcare settings involve persons with mental illnesses  Usually, these persons present  with common mental health problems or as a comorbid condition of other physical disorders and are missed  or inappropriately managed  Considering the huge burden of mental illnesses, it is necessary to make efforts  for the inculcation of an empathetic attitude toward psychiatric disorders and psychiatry as a speciality at the  undergraduate level  During training, educational interventions targeted towards them may be highly effective   Perception and knowledge of the nursing and paramedical staff about mental illnesses is also important as they  directly deal with patients and their relatives, and are also involved in disseminating health information  Misconceptions about mental illnesses, even among healthcare professionals cause people to feel ashamed and  embarrassed about their condition, leading to denial of the problem and refusal to seek help Mental Health Awareness Booklet   B   MYTHS ABOUT MENTAL ILLNESS •  Psychiatric illness is a sign of weakness  No, there are not  Psychiatric disorders have neurobiological underpinnings and need to be treated  accordingly  •  Psychiatric illness means ‘Madness’  Not all psychiatric disorders are ‘madness’  Only  % of psychiatric disorders (e g  schizophrenia and related  psychotic disorders) have symptoms of ‘madness’ or psychotic symptoms  Rest is not   •  Mental health problems are permanent  You need to take medicines lifelong    No  Not all psychiatric disorders are lifelong  Each individual’s experience with mental illness is different   The course of various psychiatric disorders can differ but\\xa0many people recover to a variable degree  •  Psychiatric medications are addictive  No, they are not  These medicines need to be taken as per doctor’s advice  On sudden stoppage, some people  may experience discontinuation symptoms  Therefore, the dose of these medicines needs to be tapered   •  People with mental disorders are kept in asylums  No  Most of the psychiatric disorders can be treated at home  Only few people with chronic psychiatric  disorders with poor social support and homeless mentally ill people are kept / treated in asylums  •  Addiction implies lack of willpower  No, it does not  As with other psychiatric disorders, addiction has a neurobiological basis  •  All people with mental illnesses are violent   This is a common myth often perpetuated by erroneous portrayals in media and literature  In reality only  a small percentage of people with certain psychiatric disorders become violent and unpredictable  Also,  there are evidences to suggest that, ‘normal’ people are more violent compared to persons with psychiatric  disorders  •  Electro Convulsive Therapy (ECT) or Shock Therapy is bad  ECT is not bad  When given under anaesthesia (i e  modified ECT) it works wonder for certain severe  mental health conditions  However, because of wrong portrayal by media and in movies, general people  developed this idea Mental Health Awareness Booklet   C  CHALLENGES FACED BY A STUDENT •  Adjusting to a new environment, particularly if staying in a hostel or mess or paying guest accommodation •  Burden of study •  Burden of frequent assessment, examinations •  Ragging by seniors •  Peer group rejection •  Rejection by member of opposite sex •  Breakup in a romantic relationship •  Pre existing psychiatric disorders or personality issues •  Pre existing medical conditions •  Family difficulties e g  ailing parent(s), poor financial condition of the family to support higher education,  broken family, recent deaths •  Difficulty is speaking and communicating in English language which is the medium of education •  Failure in examinations •  Scolding by teachersMental Health Awareness Booklet   D  COMMON PSYCHIATRIC DISORDERS     Depression ‘I often feel sad and low for minor reasons  Does this mean I am suffering from depression?’ Depression is a common psychiatric illness characterized by persistent and pervasive low mood, reduced interest  in previously pleasurable activities, decreased energy, decreased self confidence, decreased concentration,  pessimism, ideas of guilt and worthlessness, impaired sleep and in severe cases, suicidal ideas or acts  These  above mentioned symptoms should persist for most of the time of most of the days for at least   weeks  Various  psychosocial and environmental stressors play a major role  Prompt identification of the signs and symptoms and early intervention can treat such episodes effectively   Medication, psychotherapy or a combination of both can be used to treat depression  What is of concern? •  Any noticeable change in behaviour •  Being sad or moody  •  Withdrawal from others •  Changes in appearance, appetite or sleep pattern •  Dangerous or self  injurious behaviour •  Experiencing recent trauma or life crisis •  Expressing hopelessness and desire to end life, making preparations for any such act  Threatening about  committing suicide or talking about wanting to die should always be taken seriously  Not everyone who is  considering suicide will say so, and not everyone who threatens suicide will follow through with it  However,  every threat of suicide should be taken seriously  Any previous suicide attempt is an important risk factor for  any such subsequent attempt  Whom should I contact if I experience such feelings or notice such changes in a friend?  Guardian/Parent/Trusted adult/ Teacher/ Mental health professional How to take care of myself? •  Consult a mental healthcare provider  Follow the prescribed treatment diligently •  Regular physical exercise  •  Maintain regular timing for meals and sleep  •  Express your feelings to trusted friends  •  Avoid abuse of substances like alcohol and nicotine  How can I help a friend who is depressed? •  Be patient, supportive and empathetic  •  Listen to him/ her Mental Health Awareness Booklet   •  Do not ridicule or minimize their suffering  •  Offer encouragement and hope  •  Encourage them to seek treatment and help them adhere to the treatment plan     Bipolar Affective Disorder Bipolar disorder is a mood disorder characterized by fluctuations in mood, energy, activity levels, concentration,  and the ability to carry out day to day tasks  There may be alternating episodes of depression and manic/ hypomanic episodes  Manic episodes are characterised by elated mood, increased energy, goal directed  overactivity, over religiosity, pressure of speech, buying spree, engagement in high risk behaviours, increased  libido, decreased need for sleep  Bipolar disorder is usually diagnosed during late adolescence or early adulthood   Although the course of illness may vary over time, bipolar disorder requires long term treatment  Bipolar  disorder can affect every aspect of a person’s life, including their relationships, family and work life \\xa0    Schizophrenia/ Psychosis Schizophrenia and psychoses are serious mental disorders which causes significant disability  The diagnosis  is associated with stigma and persons suffering from it often face discrimination  People with schizophrenia  have an impaired perception of reality  Delusions, hallucinations, disorganization of thought and behaviour,  difficulties with memory, attention and problem solving abilities are often co existent  Treatment involves  medication, psychoeducation, family interventions, and psychosocial rehabilitation  In most of the cases, life  long medication is required  Awareness among medical students and an empathetic approach is necessary to deal with the widespread  stigma and discrimination     Anxiety disorders Anxiety is a normal experience   However, constant worrying, apprehension, inability to relax, overwhelming  anxiety in particular situations can be indicative of pathological anxiety or an anxiety disorder  Students may  have pre existing anxious trait and with exposure to stress they can be manifested  Many students use alcohol  or other substances to combat anxiety which is not only unhealthy but also compounds the problem  Obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) is a type of anxiety disorder characterized by obsessions (repeated,  intrusive, unwanted, distressing thoughts, images and impulses) and compulsions (repetitive acts that are  performed to reduce the anxiety caused by the obsession)     Substance misuse Substance misuse has become rampant in the student population  Students usually abuse substances like  nicotine, alcohol, cannabis as coping methods with stress  Often, they are initiated into substance use by peers  which eventually leads to substance dependence  All major substances abused have lifelong psychological and  physical impacts  Substance abuse can also increase impulsivity and risk taking behaviours like unprotected  sex, dangerous driving, legal problems Mental Health Awareness Booklet   Identifying harmful or dependence pattern of substance use is pertinent as they require treatment  Excessive  use of the substance, craving for it, desire to take the substance, gradually increasing the dose of substance  abused, facing physical and psychological problems once the substance is stopped and neglecting other life  pleasures encompasses some of the common presentations      Ragging/Bullying Ragging, bullying (both in person and cyberbullying) can lead to low self esteem, feelings of worthlessness,  anxiety and depression   If you face this issue, contact the college authorities for assistance   Do not react to the bully or be aggressive   Know that it is not your fault      Self harm Sometimes self harming behaviours are used as a coping mechanism  By hurting themselves, people seek relief  from emotional pain or overwhelming situations and experiences  Self harming or self injurious behaviours  include  wrist slashing, burning, hitting, head  banging etc  It is often a ‘cry’ for help  If you or someone you know is self harming, contact mental healthcare professional immediately Mental Health Awareness Booklet   E  STRESS MANAGEMENT MODULE Introduction Mental health is defined as a state of well being in which every individual realizes his or her own potential, can  cope with the normal stressors of life, can work productively and fruitfully and is able to make a contribution  to his or her community  Stress feels uncomfortable, but not every uncomfortable feeling is stress  Stress has been dubbed the “Health  Epidemic of the  st Century” by the World Health Organization  People use the word “Stress” interchangeable  with other terms such as worry, anxiety and fear, but stress is, at its heart, our conviction that we won’t be able  to cope with the challenges we’re facing  Stress affects the whole person, i e , in all the human dimensions (physical, emotional, intellectual, social, and  spiritual)  The perception of stress and the responses to it are highly individualized, not only from person to  person but also from one time to another in the same person  Broadly, the stress is classified into two: Eustress   good stress, is stress that benefits our health, like physical exercise or getting a promotion  Distress   stress that harms our health and often results from imbalances between demands made upon us and  our resources for dealing with these demands  The latter is what most people think about when they talk about  stress  However, if handled well stress can increase motivation and stimulate us  Stressors  Stressor can be any stimulus that causes an individual to experience stress  Three major categories of stressors  are:   •  Catastrophic events •  Important life events (personal stressors) •  Daily hassles (background stressors) Cause of stress & its effects Everyone has different stress triggers  Work stress tops the list  Causes of work stress include: •  Being unhappy in your job •  Having a heavy workload or too much responsibility •  Working long hours •  Having poor management, unclear expectations of your work, or no say in the decision making process •  Working under dangerous conditions •  Being insecure about your chance for advancement or risk of termination •  Having to give speeches in front of colleagues •  Facing discrimination or harassment at work, especially if your company isn’t supportiveMental Health Awareness Booklet   Life stresses can also have a big impact  Examples of life stresses are: •  The death of a loved one •  Divorce •  Loss of a job •  Increase in financial obligations •  Getting married •  Moving to a new home •  Chronic illness or injury •  Emotional problems (depression, anxiety, anger, grief, guilt, low self esteem) •  Taking care of an elderly or sick family member •  Traumatic event, such as a natural disaster, theft, rape, or violence against you or a loved one Sometimes the stress comes from inside, rather than outside  You can stress yourself out just by worrying  about things  All of these factors can lead to stress  •  Fear and uncertainty  When you regularly hear about the threat of terrorist attacks, global warming, and  toxic chemicals in food, it can cause you to feel stressed, especially because you feel like you have no  control over those events   •  Attitudes and perceptions  How you view the world or a particular situation can determine whether it  causes stress  For example, if your television set is stolen and you take the attitude, “It’s OK, my insurance  company will pay for a new one,” you’ll be far less stressed than if you think, “My TV is gone and I’ll never  get it back! What if the thieves come back to my house to steal again?”  •  Unrealistic expectations  No one is perfect  If you expect to do everything right all the time, you’re destined  to feel stressed when things don’t go as expected  •  Change  Any major life change can be stressful   even a happy event like a wedding or a job promotion   More unpleasant events, such as a divorce, major financial setback, or death in the family can be significant  sources of stress  Your stress level will differ based on your personality and how you respond to situations  Some people let  everything roll off their back  To them, work stresses and life stresses are just minor bumps in the road  Others  literally worry themselves sick  Effects of stress on health When you are in a stressful situation, your body launches a physical response  Your nervous system springs into  action, releasing hormones that prepare you to either fight or take off  It’s called the “fight or flight” response,  and it’s why, when you’re in a stressful situation, you may notice that your heartbeat speeds up, your breathing  gets faster, your muscles tense, and you start to sweat  This kind of stress is short term and temporary (acute  stress), and your body usually recovers quickly from it Mental Health Awareness Booklet   But if your stress system stays activated over a long period of time (chronic stress), it can lead to or aggravate  more serious health problems  The constant rush of stress hormones can put a lot of wear and tear on your  body, causing it to age more quickly and making it more prone to illness  If you’ve been stressed out for a short period of time, you may start to notice some of these physical signs: •  Headache •  Fatigue •  Difficulty sleeping •  Difficulty concentrating •  Upset stomach •  Irritability When stress becomes long term and is not properly addressed, it can lead to a number of more serious health  conditions, including: •  Depression •  High blood pressure •  Abnormal heartbeat (arrhythmia) •  Hardening of the arteries (atherosclerosis) •  Heart disease •  Heart attack •  Heartburn, ulcers, irritable bowel syndrome •  Upset stomach   cramps, constipation, and diarrhoea •  Weight gain or loss •  Changes in sex drive •  Fertility problems •  Flare ups of asthma or arthritis •  Skin problems such as acne, eczema, and psoriasis Management of stress People can learn to manage stress and lead happier, healthier lives  Coping with stress Coping refers to the thoughts and behaviours we use to handle stress or anticipated stress  Coping includes  efforts to control, reduce or learn to tolerate the threats that occur due to stress  Effective coping depends on  the nature of the stressor and the degree to which it is possible to control it  Coping strategies fall into three  categories:      Emotion focused coping  In this coping people try to manage their emotions in the face of stress, seeking  to change the way they feel about or perceive a problem  Examples of emotion focused coping includeMental Health Awareness Booklet   accepting sympathy from others, seeking social support, etc  Emotion focused strategies are more  frequently used when stressful situation is unchangeable      Problem focused coping  It includes taking direct action to solve problems as well as changing or modifying  the stressful problem or the source of stress  Problem focused strategy leads to change in behaviour or  the development of a plan of action to deal with stress  Starting a group study to improve poor classroom  performance is an example of Problem  focused coping     Avoidance coping  In this coping style people try to minimize or avoid the threatening event  People who  cope using avoidance may make enough cognitive and emotional efforts to anticipate and manage long  term problems Coping resources These resources can broadly be divided into:    Cognitive coping strategies and     Physical / behavioural coping strategies Some of these coping strategies will suit some people, others will not  The key is to have a range of resources  that can be applied, depending upon the situation and the individual   It is important to have strategies one is  comfortable using  Cognitive coping strategies  These refer to ways of dealing with stress using our minds   Cognitive coping strategies are a good way to  combat stress producing thoughts    Stress management starts with identifying the sources of stress in your life •  Reframing – focus on the good not the bad; think in terms of wants instead of shoulds  It’s best if our  thinking is related to our goals   For example, “I want to read and understand this chapter in Chemistry so  I do well in my lab practical” instead of “I have to read this difficult chapter in Chemistry”  •  Challenging negative thinking – stopping the negative thoughts we may have about a situation or ourselves     Examples of negative thoughts include expecting failure, putting yourself down, feelings of inadequacy   a  thought such as “Everyone else seems to understand this except me ” In order to gain control of negative thoughts or worries, you must first become aware of them   Next, yell  “Stop!” to yourself when they occur   Try replacing with positive affirmations or at least challenge or question  any irrationality of the thoughts  •  Positive self talk – using positive language and statements to ourselves  These are sometimes referred to  as positive affirmations; they are useful for building confidence and challenging negative thoughts  For  example, “I can do this or understand this” or “I’ll try my best”   These work best when they are realistic  and tailored to your needs and goals    •  Count to ten – this allows you time to gain control and perhaps rethink the situation or come up with a  better coping strategy Mental Health Awareness Booklet   •  Cost benefit analysis – asking yourself questions about the worth of thinking, feeling or acting a particular  way   “Is it helping me to get things done when I think this way?”  “Is it worth getting upset over?”  “Am I  making the best use of my time?” •  Keeping perspective – when under stress it is easy to lose perspective; things can seem insurmountable     Some questions to ask yourself:  Is this really a problem?  Is this a problem anyone else has had?  Can I  prioritise the problems?  Does it really matter? “Look on the bright side of life!”   Cultivate optimism  •  Reducing uncertainty – seek any information or clarification you may require to reduce the uncertainty     It helps to ask in a positive way   Situations that are difficult to classify, are obscure or have multiple  meanings can create stress  •  Using imagery/visualisation –imagining yourself in a pleasant or a successful situation to help reduce  stress  One way to use imagery is as a relaxation tool; try to remember the pleasure of an experience you’ve  had or a place you’ve been   The more senses you involve in the image the more realistic, therefore the  more powerful   This strategy is often combined with deep breathing or relaxation exercises  Behavioural coping strategies  These refer to ways of dealing with stress by doing something or taking action to reduce the stress experienced    Examples of these strategies are: •  Physical exercise – aerobic exercise is the most beneficial strategy for reducing stress    It releases  neurochemicals in the brain that aid concentration   For some people, even a short walk is sufficient to  relieve stress  •  Relaxation – from simple relaxation such as dropping the head forward and rolling it gently from side  to side or simply stretching, to more complex progressive relaxation exercises   Progressive relaxation  involves tensing and releasing isolated muscle groups until muscles are relaxed    •  Breathing – from simple deep breaths to more complex breathing exercises related to relaxation and  meditation    •  Smile and Laugh   gives us energy and helps to lighten the load; relaxes muscles in the face  •  Time management – specific strategies such as clarifying priorities, setting goals, evaluating how time is  spent, developing an action plan, overcoming procrastination and organising time   These help us to cope  with the numerous demands placed upon us, often a source of stress   •  Social Support/Friends – encourage the development and nurturing of relationships  There is an association  between good social support and a reduced risk of drop out  •  Seek Help – to help us cope with unmanageable stress  This is a sign of taking control, not of weakness     There are many supports available in college for students including Student Health Service, Student  Counselling Service, Mental Health Helpline, College Mentors and the Chaplaincy '"
